    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <p>Hi, my name is Alex Cook. I am software engineer and data fiend in Portland, OR. I graduated March 2016 from the University of Oregon with a degree in Applied Physics.</p>
    <p>This is my first foray into front-end web development. I hope you like it. Enjoy your stay. </p>
    <p>This portfolio runs on PSQL, EC2, Apache, and Flask. The PEAF stack. That's a thing, right? Visualizations were done using D3.js.</p>
    <p>Sometimes I use Redis, too. I automate processes with Cron. The website is stylized using Bootstrap 3.</p>
    <p>You can checkout the source code for this project <a href="https://www.github.com/alexanderbcook/portfolio">here.</a></p>
