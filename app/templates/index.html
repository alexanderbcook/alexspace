    <p>Hi, my name is Alex Cook. I am software engineer in Portland, OR. I graduated March 2016 from the University of Oregon with a degree in Applied Physics. Just before
    my graduation, I was offered a data engineering position at a small startup, <a href="https://www.carevoyance.com/">Carevoyance.</a> I now am employed in a Dev-Ops role at <a href="https://www.wellsource.com/">Wellsource.</a> </p>
    <p> Most of my experience has been in the back-end, building data warehouses, pipelines, and optimizing business applications. 
    As such, this is my first foray into front-end web development. I hope you like it. Enjoy your stay. </p>
    <p>This portfolio runs on PSQL, EC2, Apache, and Flask. The PEAF stack. That's a thing, right? I use Redis, too. I automate processes with Cron
    The website is stylized using Bootstrap 4. Visualizations were done using D3.js.</p>
